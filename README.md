# Epicurean-Harnessing-CNNs-for-Hotdog-Detection

## Project Description
This project aims to develop an advanced image classification system to accurately distinguish between images of "hotdogs" and "not-hotdog". Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a deep learning architecture suited for image recognition tasks, our system analyzes and classifies images using a high-quality dataset curated from public sources. The goal is to provide robust hotdog detection, paving the way for more sophisticated food recognition systems.

The system is deployed in a user-friendly interface, allowing users to upload images and receive instant feedback on whether the image is a hotdog or not.

## Use Cases
1. **Quality Control in Food Manufacturing**: Automate the inspection of hotdog products on a production line to ensure quality and prevent mislabeling.
2. **Enhanced Customer Experience in Food Delivery**: Enable customers to verify their food orders using the app, ensuring they receive the correct items.
3. **Social Media Content Moderation**: Automatically filter user-generated content on social media to maintain a curated brand presence by distinguishing relevant images.

## Technical Architecture
The system comprises a CNN model integrated with a Flask web application. The workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, model building, and deployment.
